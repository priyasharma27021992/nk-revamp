					Every child deserves the chance to dream, learn, and grow. We truly
					believe that while many NGOs are doing impact-making work, such as
					providing food, medical aid, and extra classes and we respect them.

						We started Nanhe Khwab Charitable Trust to give the underprivileged
						kids a chance to change their future(and their onward generations)
						using Education as their Superpower.
					</span>
					Education, in our view, holds the key to solving many global
					challenges. Our approach goes beyond short-term interventions â€“ we are
					committed to ensuring that education lasts at least until the 12th
					grade and, when possible, even beyond into college, providing children
					with enhanced employment prospects for a brighter future.
